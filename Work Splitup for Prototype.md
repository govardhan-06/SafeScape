Given the scope of the project and the seven-day timeline, the goal should be to implement the core features that can effectively showcase the Women Safety Analytics System. Here’s a plan for what can be realistically achieved by a beginner to intermediate level team, along with a work split-up among the 6 team members.

### Core Features to Implement within 7 Days:

1. **Real-Time Person Detection**
2. **Gender Classification**
3. **Lone Woman Detection at Night**
4. **Detection of a Woman Surrounded by Men**
5. **Basic Alert System**
6. **Dashboard for Monitoring**

### Work Split-Up

1. **ML Engineer (Member 1)**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - **Day 1-2**: Implement real-time person detection using a pre-trained object detection model like MobileNet SSD.
     - **Day 3-4**: Implement gender classification using a pre-trained model.
     - **Day 5**: Combine the detection and classification logic to identify lone women at night and women surrounded by men.
     - **Day 6**: Assist with integrating ML models into the backend.
     - **Day 7**: Optimize model performance and assist in final testing.
   - **Tools**: Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch.

2. **Backend Developers (Members 2 & 3)**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - **Day 1**: Set up the server infrastructure and database.
     - **Day 2-3**: Develop the REST APIs for interacting with the ML models (person detection, gender classification).
     - **Day 4-5**: Implement logic for lone woman detection at night and detection of a woman surrounded by men.
     - **Day 6**: Develop the basic alert system to send notifications via email or dashboard when potential threats are detected.
     - **Day 7**: Final testing, integration, and deployment.
   - **Tools**: Python, Flask/Django, PostgreSQL/MongoDB.

3. **Frontend Developers (Members 4 & 5)**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - **Day 1-2**: Design the UI for the dashboard using wireframes provided by the UI/UX designer.
     - **Day 3-5**: Develop the web-based dashboard using React.js. Display real-time alerts, statistics, and analytics.
     - **Day 6**: Integrate the dashboard with backend APIs to fetch real-time data.
     - **Day 7**: Conduct testing and ensure responsive design and cross-browser compatibility.
   - **Tools**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Chart.js.

4. **UI/UX Designer (Member 6)**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - **Day 1**: Create wireframes and user flow for the dashboard and alert system.
     - **Day 2**: Design the UI/UX of the dashboard, focusing on user-friendly navigation and visualization of alerts.
     - **Day 3-5**: Collaborate with frontend developers to implement the design, ensuring consistency.
     - **Day 6-7**: Conduct usability testing, gather feedback, and make final adjustments to the UI.
   - **Tools**: Figma/Adobe XD, Sketch.

### Timeline Overview

- **Day 1**: 
  - Team alignment and setup: ML Engineer starts with person detection; Backend Developers set up the server; Frontend Developers and UI/UX Designer work on dashboard wireframes.
  
- **Day 2-3**: 
  - ML Engineer works on gender classification; Backend Developers develop APIs; Frontend Developers build the dashboard structure; UI/UX Designer finalizes design.

- **Day 4-5**: 
  - ML Engineer and Backend Developers integrate detection logic for lone woman and woman surrounded by men; Frontend Developers start connecting APIs to the dashboard.

- **Day 6**: 
  - Backend Developers and Frontend Developers integrate the alert system; ML Engineer optimizes models; UI/UX Designer conducts usability testing.

- **Day 7**: 
  - Final testing, integration, deployment, and project review.

### Development Strategy

1. **Use Pre-Trained Models**: Focus on integrating and tuning pre-trained models to save time.
2. **Agile Development**: Iterate quickly on core features, testing each as they’re developed.
3. **Collaboration**: Ensure daily communication among team members to address any blockers immediately.

### Prioritization

If time runs short, prioritize the following:
- Real-time person detection and gender classification.
- Lone woman detection at night.
- Basic alert system.
  
The remaining features can be considered as stretch goals if time allows. This plan is tailored to maximize the team’s productivity within the available timeframe while covering the essential functionality of the prototype.
