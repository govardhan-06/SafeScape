## Problem Statement

 - **PS Number**: SIH1605

 - **Title**: Women Safety Analytics – Protecting Women from safety threats

 - **Background**: The growing concern for the safety of women and the increase in crimes against women in various cities, highlight the need for advanced surveillance and analytical solutions to protect women from various possible threats. We need a promising approach to address these issues through real-time threat detection software. 

 - **Detailed Description**: By leveraging advanced analytics through real-time monitoring, Women Safety Analytics should create safer environments for women and assist law enforcement in effectively addressing and preventing crimes against women. The proactive approach of detecting anomalies and generating alerts can play a crucial role in enhancing public safety and fostering a secure atmosphere for women. Women safety analytics software should continuously monitor the scene to count the number of men and women present, offering insights into gender distribution in specific locations and times. It should identify unusual patterns, such as a lone woman at night, unusual gestures and generates alerts to pre-empt potential incidents. Advantages of the system: ? By providing real-time monitoring and alerts, the system helps to create a safer environment for women. ? Early detection enables law enforcement to intervene before situations escalate. ? Continuous analysis provides valuable data to identify hotspots and trends, aiding in strategic planning for city safety.

 - **Expected Solution**: Women safety analytics should include the following functionalities 
    1. Person detection along with Gender Classification
    2. Gender Distribution : Count the number of men and women present in the scene
    3. Identifying a Lone Woman at Night time
    4. Detection of a Woman Surrounded by Men
    5. Recognizing SOS situation through gesture analytics
    6. Identifying hotspots where incidents are more likely to occur, based on the past alerts

## Layman’s Explanation

1. _Watching the Area:_

   - Imagine there’s a camera set up in a public place, like a park or a street. This camera is continuously recording what’s happening in that area.

2. _Smart Eyes:_

   - The system uses computer "vision" to watch the video feed from the camera. Think of it as having a smart pair of eyes that can see and understand what’s going on in the video.

3. _Counting People:_

   - The smart system can count how many people are in the camera's view and can tell whether they are men or women. It keeps track of this information in real-time.

4. _Spotting Unusual Situations:_

   - The system is designed to notice things that might be unusual or potentially dangerous. For example:
     - It can detect if a woman is alone at night, which might be a sign that she needs help.
     - It can spot if a woman is surrounded by a large group of men, which might be concerning.
     - It can recognize certain gestures or actions that suggest someone might be in distress.

5. _Sending Alerts:_

   - If the system detects something unusual or potentially dangerous, it sends an alert. This alert could be sent to local authorities or security personnel so they can quickly respond to the situation.

6. _Learning from Past Data:_

   - The system also keeps track of past incidents and patterns. For example, if certain areas are known to have more incidents, the system can highlight these hotspots, helping authorities to be more prepared.

7. _User Dashboard:_
   - All the information and alerts are displayed on a user-friendly dashboard. This is like a control center where security personnel or safety organizations can see what's happening and take necessary actions.

## How It Helps

- _Real-time Safety:_ By constantly monitoring and sending alerts, the system helps ensure that any potential issues are noticed quickly.
- _Preventive Measures:_ It allows for timely intervention before a situation escalates, making public places safer.
- _Data Insights:_ By analyzing patterns and past incidents, the system helps in understanding where safety measures are needed the most.

In summary, the Women Safety Analytics System acts like a smart safety watchtower, keeping an eye on public areas to detect and prevent potential threats to women, and ensuring timely responses through alerts and insights.
